## VendorMatch

**VendorMatch is a proof-of-concept built for the Agentic AI Hackathon 2025 with IBM watsonx Orchestrate by lablab.ai.**

VendorMatch is an AI-powered vendor discovery experience that helps users quickly find US‑based service providers
based on location, budget, and preferences. The current POC focuses on a single agent that searches a curated dataset
and surfaces relevant vendors through a conversational interface embedded with IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

### Features

- **AI‑assisted vendor discovery**: Ask the embedded chat agent for vendors (e.g., *“Show me plumbers within 5 miles of Houston under \$200”*) and receive structured suggestions from the dataset.
- **Hackathon‑ready UX**: A clean, premium, single‑page UI highlighting the problem, approach, and future roadmap for multi‑agent coordination.
- **Future booking agent (concept)**: The design anticipates a second agent responsible for booking and follow‑ups (e.g., appointment scheduling, confirmations).
- **Multi‑channel vision**: Copy and layout emphasize future integrations such as WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and web chat.

### How to Use

1. Open the deployed VendorMatch URL in your browser (desktop or mobile).
2. Wait a moment for the IBM watsonx Orchestrate embedded webchat to load.
3. Click the **chat button in the bottom‑right corner** to open the chatbot window.
4. Start the conversation with a request such as:
   - *“Show me plumbers within 5 miles of Houston under \$200.”*
   - *“Find highly rated electricians in San Diego.”*
5. Review the suggested vendors and iterate with follow‑up questions (e.g., change budget, radius, or city).
